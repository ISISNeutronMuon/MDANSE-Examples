The simulation scripts included in this tutorial will
all write their output here.

Most of the time we assume that the users will have
access to a graphical session and will be using
the MDANSE GUI. However, if this is not the case
for you, it may be easier to write the analysis
results to a text file.

As an example, script2_temperature contains a line:
'output_files': ('../mdanse_outputs/temperature', ['MDAFormat']),  # output_files
which results in a HDF5 file with an .mda extension being created.

You can replace the 'MDAFormat' with, or add to the list, an entry
'TextFormat' , as in:
'output_files': ('../mdanse_outputs/temperature', ['MDAFormat', 'TextFormat']),  # output_files
which will make MDANSE output a TAR archive containing text files with
the same results as the .mda file.
